license = BSD
long_description = Quantities is designed to handle arithmetic and conversions
    of physical quantities, which have a magnitude, dimensionality specified by
    various units, and possibly an uncertainty. See the `tutorial 
    <http://packages.python.org/quantities/user/tutorial.html>`_ for examples.
    Quantities builds on the popular numpy library and is designed to work with
    numpy ufuncs, many of which are already supported. Quantities is actively
    developed, and while the current features and API are stable, test coverage
    is incomplete and so the package is not suggested for production use.
